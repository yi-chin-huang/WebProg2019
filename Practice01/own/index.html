			There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
			instance you can make words <b>bold, important</b>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small...</small>
			<span class = "text-bg-color">the</span> <strike>list</strike> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
		</p>

		<p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
			<blockquote>
			    Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
			    time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
			    we seek.
			</blockquote>

		<h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
		<div>
			A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
			and take up the full width available.
		</div>
		<span>
			And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
		</span>
