        There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
        instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>,<i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small...</small> <mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <u>goes</u> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.<br>
    </div>

    <div>
        You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
        <blockquote>

            Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
            time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
            we seek.

        </blockquote>

        <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
    </div>

    <div>A &lt;&nbsp;div&nbsp;&gt; is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
    and take up the full width available.
    <span>And a &lt;&nbsp;span&nbsp;&gt; tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span>
